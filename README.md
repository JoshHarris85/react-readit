# React-Readit

# Udacity Readable Project
This is the second project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program.
The application is a reddit clone that allows you to create posts, create comments,
edit posts, edit comments, vote on comments, and vote on posts.

## Installation
* Install and start API server
    - `cd React-Readit/React-Readit-API/api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the frontend app
    - `cd React-Readit/React-Readit-Frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

You will now find an instance of the application running on your localhost.
